# Placeholder for trace-tree.png

This file should be replaced with the actual trace tree image (image_82f00d.jpg renamed to trace-tree.png).

For now, the consumer page will work without the image, but it's recommended to add:
- A visual representation of the product journey
- Farm → Processor → Retailer flow diagram
- Can be an SVG, PNG, or JPG format
- Recommended size: 800x600px or larger
